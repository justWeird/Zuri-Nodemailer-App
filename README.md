# Zuri-Nodemailer-App
This is a Node JS app that automatically sends an email to the desired email address.

## How it works
In '.env', enter your email credentials: Username and Password (or 2FA if you are using a gmail account to send email).
In 'index.js', make changes to the 'mailOptions' method and set the email address you want to send to.
Additionally, make changes to the subject and text values. If you want to render an email in html, simply add a 'html' key and specify the value with html formatting.
